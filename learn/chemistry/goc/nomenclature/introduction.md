The misleading name ‘’organic’’ is a relic of the days when chemical compounds were divided into two classes, Inorganic and organic, depending upon where they had come from. Inorganic compounds were those obtained from minerals; organic compounds were those obtained from vegetable or animal sources. Indeed, until 1850 many chemists believed that the organic compounds must have their origin in living forms and could never be synthesized. Wohler converted inorganic compound ammonium cyanate  found from non living matters into urea an organic compound.
